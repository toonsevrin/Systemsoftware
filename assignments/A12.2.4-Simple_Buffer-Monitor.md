# A12.2.4: Simple buffer: Monitor
This is not really an assignment...
Important parts are:
- synchronized keyword
- wait() puts the thread in a waiting state (WAIT), can and should be used in synchronized block
- notifyAll() wakes up all waiting threads, should be used in synchronized block

```java

public class BufferExample

        Thread p1 = new PutThread(1, buffer);

        Thread p3 = new PutThread(3, buffer);
        Thread p4 = new PutThread(4, buffer);
        Thread p5 = new PutThread(5, buffer);
        Thread p6 = new PutThread(6, buffer);

        Thread g1 = new GetThread(1, buffer);
        Thread g2 = new GetThread(2, buffer);
        Thread g3 = new GetThread(3, buffer);

        // launch the threads
        p1.start();
        p2.start();
