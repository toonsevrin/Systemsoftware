# A10.2 Bounded Buffer - Atomic Boolean
In the example on Toledo a normal boolean is used with this mutex:
```java
while ( busy )
{   }
busy = true;

//critical region

busy = false
```

Obviously this is not atomic and can lead to deadlock:
Thread 1 and 2 evaluate that busy is set to false (so they both escape while loop)
They both put busy = true and execute their critical regions simultaneously. Race conditions still exist => not a real mutex.

Solution: Use AtomicBoolean: A java class with atomic operations (see 10.3).

## 10.3 Atomic boolean solution:
This solution is still not good!
Two threads can still escape the while loop at the same time! A GOTO start; (doesn't exist in java but you get the point) should be used instead of the busy while loop. Not sure if we can get concurrency errors from reading the 'spaces' while it's being written too, but that doesn't sound so safe either.
