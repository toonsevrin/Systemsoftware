# Eisenberg & Mcguire
An algorithm to create a mutex without hardware support.
Actually we don't really need to understand this...
Lamport's Bakery algorithm is an improved version of this?


Transcription of Eisenberg & Mcguire:
- Set state to WAITING
- Continue if you have the turn or wait until all processes are IDLE //process with turn may still get past this
- Set state to CLAIM
- Find the first process besides ourselves that is CLAIM
- If none exist AND we have claim || the person with the claim is still idle, claim turn and proceed
- critical section
- pass on turn to someone who needs it/keep it
- set to IDLE

## Examples: 
2 processes { A, B } are both idle

### Example 1
A has claim and wants resource:
- Sets state to waiting
- Continues
- Sets state to Claim
- Continue
- Critical section
- Keep claim
- Idle

B wants resource:
- Sets state to Waiting
- Continues (all processes idle)

A wants resource again:
- Sets state to waiting
